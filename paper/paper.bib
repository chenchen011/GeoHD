	abstract = {Hotspot detection from geo-r­ eferenced urban data is critical for smart city research, such as traffic management and policy making. However, the classical clustering or classification approach for hotspot detection mainly aims at identifying “hotspot areas” rather than specific points, and the setting of global parameters such as search bandwidth can lead to inaccurate results when processing multi-­density urban data. In this article, a data-­driven adaptive hotspot detection (AHD) approach based on kernel density analysis is proposed and applied to various spatial objects. The adaptive search bandwidth is automatically calculated depending on the local density. Window detection is used to extract the specific hotspots in AHD, thus realizing a small-­ scale characterization of urban hotspots. Through the trajectory data of Harbin City taxis and New York City crime data, Geo-­information Tupu is used to analyze the obtained specific hotspots and verify the effectiveness of AHD, providing new ideas for further research.},

However, the application of classic density-based clustering algorithms on multi-density data can produce inaccurate results. Since metropolitan cities are heavily characterized by variable densities, multi-density clustering seems to be more appropriate to discover city hotspots. This paper presents CHD (City Hotspot Detector), a multi-density approach to discover urban hotspots in a city, by reporting an extensive comparative analysis with three classic density-based clustering algorithms, on both state-of-the-art and real-world datasets. The comparative experimental evaluation in an urban scenario shows that the proposed multi-density algorithm, enhanced by an additional rolling moving average technique, detects higher quality city hotspots than other classic density-based approaches proposed in literature.},

	abstract = {Leveraged by a large-scale diffusion of sensing networks and scanning devices in modern cities, huge volumes of geo-referenced urban data are collected every day. Such an amount of information is analyzed to discover data-driven models, which can be exploited to tackle the major issues that cities face, including air pollution, virus diffusion, human mobility, crime forecasting, traffic flows, etc. In particular, the detection of city hotspots is de facto a valuable organization technique for framing detailed knowledge of a metropolitan area, providing high-level summaries for spatial datasets, which are a valuable support for planners, scientists, and policymakers. However, while classic density-based clustering algorithms show to be suitable for discovering hotspots characterized by homogeneous density, their application on multi-density data can produce inaccurate results. In fact, a proper threshold setting is very difficult when clusters in different regions have considerably different densities, or clusters with different density levels are nested. For such a reason, since metropolitan cities are heavily characterized by variable densities, multi-density clustering seems to be more appropriate for discovering city hotspots. Indeed, such algorithms rely on multiple minimum threshold values and are able to detect multiple pattern distributions of different densities, aiming at distinguishing between several density regions, which may or may not be nested and are generally of a non-convex shape. This paper discusses the research issues and challenges for analyzing urban data, aimed at discovering multi-density hotspots in urban areas. In particular, the study compares the four approaches (DBSCAN, OPTICS-xi, HDBSCAN, and CHD) proposed in the literature for clustering urban data and analyzes their performance on both state-of-the-art and real-world datasets. Experimental results show that multi-density clustering algorithms generally achieve better results on urban data than classic density-based algorithms.},

	abstract = {Traditionally, data have been collected to measure and improve the performance of incident management (IM). While these data are less detailed than crash records, they are timelier and contain useful attributes typically not reported in the crash database. This paper proposes the use of Getis–Ord (Gi*) spatial statistics to identify hot spots on freeways from an IM database while selected impact attributes are incorporated into the analysis. The Gi* spatial statistics jointly evaluate the spatial dependency effect of the frequency and attribute values within the framework of the conceptualized spatial relationship. The application of the method was demonstrated through a case study by using the incident database from the Houston, Texas, Transportation Management Center (TranStar). The method successfully identified the clusters of high-impact accidents from more than 30,000 accident records from 2006 to 2008. The accident duration was used as a proxy measure of its impact.
