	abstract = {Hotspot detection from geo-r­ eferenced urban data is critical for smart city research, such as traffic management and policy making. However, the classical clustering or classification approach for hotspot detection mainly aims at identifying “hotspot areas” rather than specific points, and the setting of global parameters such as search bandwidth can lead to inaccurate results when processing multi-­density urban data. In this article, a data-­driven adaptive hotspot detection (AHD) approach based on kernel density analysis is proposed and applied to various spatial objects. The adaptive search bandwidth is automatically calculated depending on the local density. Window detection is used to extract the specific hotspots in AHD, thus realizing a small-­ scale characterization of urban hotspots. Through the trajectory data of Harbin City taxis and New York City crime data, Geo-­information Tupu is used to analyze the obtained specific hotspots and verify the effectiveness of AHD, providing new ideas for further research.},

Such an amount of information is analyzed to discover data-driven models, which can be exploited to tackle the major issues that cities face, including air pollution, virus diffusion, human mobility, crime forecasting, traffic flows, etc. In particular, the detection of city hotspots is de facto a valuable organization technique for framing detailed knowledge of a metropolitan area, providing high-level summaries for spatial datasets, which are a valuable support for planners, scientists, and policymakers. However, while classic density-based clustering algorithms show to be suitable for discovering hotspots characterized by homogeneous density, their application on multi-density data can produce inaccurate results. In fact, a proper threshold setting is very difficult when clusters in different regions have considerably different densities, or clusters with different density levels are nested. For such a reason, since metropolitan cities are heavily characterized by variable densities, multi-density clustering seems to be more appropriate for discovering city hotspots. Indeed, such algorithms rely on multiple minimum threshold values and are able to detect multiple pattern distributions of different densities, aiming at distinguishing between several density regions, which may or may not be nested and are generally of a non-convex shape. This paper discusses the research issues and challenges for analyzing urban data, aimed at discovering multi-density hotspots in urban areas. In particular, the study compares the four approaches (DBSCAN, OPTICS-xi, HDBSCAN, and CHD) proposed in the literature for clustering urban data and analyzes their performance on both state-of-the-art and real-world datasets. Experimental results show that multi-density clustering algorithms generally achieve better results on urban data than classic density-based algorithms.},

The Gi* spatial statistics jointly evaluate the spatial dependency effect of the frequency and attribute values within the framework of the conceptualized spatial relationship. The application of the method was demonstrated through a case study by using the incident database from the Houston, Texas, Transportation Management Center (TranStar).

	abstract = {With the development of information technology, it is possible to explore the spatial-temporal distribution characteristics of taxi travel demand by examining taxi GPS location data in order to master the actual supply and demand levels of different hot spots at different time periods. At present, in hot spot mining, the existing research on the clustering of passenger hot spots has some performance problems, such as insufficient clustering accuracy and high algorithm time complexity. The purpose of this paper is to propose a two-level subdivision concept and improve the K-means++ algorithm to finish the fine clustering of hot spots of taxi passengers. The first-level subdivision establishes a dynamic adjustable region with time and geographical range. In the second layer, a Gaussian mixture model is used for the data distribution statistics, and the optimal subdivision area number is determined according to the minimum principle of the Akaike information criterion and Bayesian information criterion. The SSE (sum of the square distance errors) is used to determine the optimal cluster number 
\$k\$
for each local area. Finally, the K-means++ algorithm is used to complete the clustering of each local area. A week of green taxi data from New York City was used to validate the method and compare it to the traditional K-means and DBSCAN approaches. The proposed method achieved better accuracy with comparable time consumption. This demonstrated the value of the approach for hot spot data mining although clustering still has some important advantages. In addition, the hot spots in the morning peak and weekend are displayed visually, which is helpful to provide the guidance for urban transportation and planning.},

	abstract = {When getting on and off the taxis, people prefer to choose around landmarks, such as a shopping mall, the gate of a residential unit, or a road intersection. This preference leads to multiple local peaks in spatial density, existing in both highly popular and less popular regions. These multiple local peaks provide a natural form to describe small-scale hotspots where the pick-up and drop-off events actually happen. However, they have not been fully studied. In this paper, we propose the local maximum density (LMD) approach to identify the hotspots as a small area around a local maximum density of incidents. It is evaluated using a 6-month taxi dataset of Wuhan City, where 90 m × 90 m square is recommended as the size of a hotspot by LMD. Results show that LMD not only identifies multiple local hotspots in highly popular regions, but also detects potential hotspots in less popular regions. Moreover, a non-uniform spatial pattern is found between pick-up and drop-off local hotspots. Comparing with pick-up behaviors, drop-off behaviors diffuse more in less popular hotspots, but also concentrate more on highly popular hotspots. The driving factors of this phenomenon are further explored by analyzing the match mode of pick-up and drop-off local hotspots with different popularity.},

With the objective to prevent and reduce road traffic crashes, this study proposes a comprehensive spatiotemporal analysis method that integrates the time-space cube analysis, spatial autocorrelation analysis, and emerging hot spot analysis for exploring the traffic crash evolution characteristics and identifying crash hot spots. These analyses are all conducted by the corresponding toolbox of ArcGIS 10.5. Then, a small sized-city of China (i.e., Wujiang) is selected as the case study, and the historical traffic crash data occurring at the road intersections of Wujiang for the year 2016 are analyzed by the proposed method. The analysis process identifies the high incidence locations of traffic crashes, then presents the spatial change trend and statistical significance of the crash locations. Finally, different types of crash hotspots, as well as their evolution patterns over time, are determined. The results illustrate that the traffic crash hotspots of road intersections are primarily distributed in the Northeast area of Wujiang’s major urban area, while the crash cold spots are concentrated in the Southwest of Wujiang, which points out the direction for crash prevention. In addition, the finding has a potential engineering application value, and it is of great significance to the sustainable development of Wujiang.},

	abstract = {Background: 
A key issue in the analysis of many spatial processes is the choice of an appropriate scale for the analysis. Smaller geographical units are generally preferable for the study of human phenomena because they are less likely to cause heterogeneous groups to be conflated. However, it can be harder to obtain data for small units and small-number problems can frustrate quantitative analysis. This research presents a new approach that can be used to estimate the most appropriate scale at which to aggregate point data to areas.

Data and methods:
The proposed method works by creating a number of regular grids with iteratively smaller cell sizes (increasing grid resolution) and estimating the similarity between two realisations of the point pattern at each resolution. The method is applied first to simulated point patterns and then to real publicly available crime data from the city of Vancouver, Canada. The crime types tested are residential burglary, commercial burglary, theft from vehicle and theft of bike.

Findings:
The results provide evidence for the size of spatial unit that is the most appropriate for the different types of crime studied. Importantly, the results are dependent on both the number of events in the data and the degree of spatial clustering, so a single 'appropriate' scale is not identified. The method is nevertheless useful as a means of better estimating what spatial scale might be appropriate for a particular piece of analysis.},

	abstract = {In recent years, data generated in the field of transportation has begun to explode. Individual continuous tracking data, such as mobile phone data, IC smart card data, taxi GPS data, bus GPS data and bicycle sharing order data, also known as “spatio-temporal big data” or “Track \&Trace data” (Harrison et al., 2020), has great potential for applications in datadriven transportation research. These spatio-temporal big data typically require three aspects of information (Zhang et al., 2021): Who? When? Where? They are characterized by high data quality, large collection scope, and fine-grained spatio-temporal information, which can fully capture the daily activities of individuals and their travel behavior in the city in both temporal and spatial dimensions. The emergence of these data provides new ways and opportunities for potential transportation demand analysis and travel mechanism understanding in supporting urban transportation planning and management (Chen et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020). However, processing with these multi-source spatio-temporal big data usually requires a series of similar processing procedure (e.g., data quality assessment, data preprocessing, data cleaning, data gridding, data aggregation, and data visualization). There is an urgent need for a one-size-fits-all tool that can adapt to the various processing demands of different transportation data in this field.},

GIS technology allows the organization, manipulation, analysis, and visualization of spatial data, often uncovering relationships, patterns, and trends. It is an important tool for urban planning (Maantay and Ziegler 2006), public health (Cromley and McLafferty 2002), law enforcement (Chainey and Ratcliffe 2005), ecology (Johnston 1998), transportation (Thill 2000), demographics (Peters and MacDonald 2004), resource management (Pettit et al. 2008), and many other industries (see http://www.esri.com/industries.html). Traditional GIS analysis techniques include spatial queries, map overlay, buffer analysis, interpolation, and proximity calculations (Mitchell 1999). Along with basic cartographic and data management tools, these analytical techniques have long been a foundation for geographic information software. Tools to perform spatial analysis have been extended over the years to include geostatistical techniques (Smith et al. 2006), raster analysis (Tomlin 1990), analytical methods for business (Pick 2008), 3D analysis (Abdul-Rahman et al. 2006), network analytics (Okabe et al. 2006), space-time dynamics (Peuquet 2002), and techniques specific to a variety of industries (e.g., Miller and Shaw 2001).
